SQL (Structured Query Language) is a programming language used to manage and manipulate relational databases.

Here are some basic SQL commands and examples:

SELECT: used to query a database and retrieve specific data.

Example:
SELECT first_name, last_name, salary FROM employees;


INSERT: used to add new data to a table.

Example:
INSERT INTO employees (first_name, last_name, salary) VALUES ('John', 'Doe', 50000);

UPDATE: used to modify existing data in a table.

Example:
UPDATE employees SET salary = 55000 WHERE first_name = 'John' AND last_name = 'Doe';

DELETE: used to delete data from a table.

Example:
DELETE FROM employees WHERE first_name = 'John' AND last_name = 'Doe';

WHERE: used to filter the result set of a SELECT, UPDATE, or DELETE statement.

Example:
SELECT first_name, last_name, salary FROM employees WHERE salary > 50000;


SQL aggregate functions are used to perform a calculation on a set of values and return a single value. Some common aggregate functions include:

COUNT(): returns the number of rows in a table or the number of non-NULL values in a column.

Example:
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM employees; 


SUM(): returns the sum of all non-NULL values in a column.

Example:
SELECT SUM(salary) FROM employees;

AVG(): returns the average of all non-NULL values in a column.

Example:
SELECT AVG(salary) FROM employees;


MIN(): returns the minimum non-NULL value in a column.

Example:
SELECT MIN(salary) FROM employees;

MAX(): returns the maximum non-NULL value in a column.

Example:
SELECT MAX(salary) FROM employees;

GROUP BY: groups rows by one or more columns, and can be used in combination with aggregate functions to calculate values for each group.

Example:
SELECT department, COUNT(*) FROM employees GROUP BY department;

HAVING: used to filter groups of rows based on a aggregate function.

Example:
SELECT department, COUNT(*) FROM employees GROUP BY department HAVING COUNT(*) > 5;


It is important to note that aggregate functions only work on numerical columns and will not work on text columns.



A JOIN operation in SQL combines rows from two or more tables based on a related column between them. This allows you to query data from multiple tables as if they were a single table.

There are several types of JOINs:

INNER JOIN: returns only the rows that have matching values in both tables.

Example:
SELECT employees.first_name, employees.last_name, departments.name 
FROM employees 
INNER JOIN departments ON employees.department_id = departments.id;


LEFT JOIN (or LEFT OUTER JOIN): returns all rows from the left table, and any matching rows from the right table. If there is no match, NULL values will be returned for right table's columns.

Example:
SELECT employees.first_name, employees.last_name, departments.name 
FROM employees 
LEFT JOIN departments ON employees.department_id = departments.id;


RIGHT JOIN (or RIGHT OUTER JOIN): returns all rows from the right table, and any matching rows from the left table. If there is no match, NULL values will be returned for left table's columns.

Example:
SELECT employees.first_name, employees.last_name, departments.name 
FROM employees 
RIGHT JOIN departments ON employees.department_id = departments.id;


FULL JOIN (or FULL OUTER JOIN): returns all rows from both tables, and any matching rows will be combined into a single row. If there is no match, NULL values will be returned for the non-matching columns.

Example:
SELECT employees.first_name, employees.last_name, departments.name 
FROM employees 
FULL JOIN departments ON employees.department_id = departments.id;


CROSS JOIN: returns the Cartesian product of the two tables, which is every possible combination of rows from the two tables.

Example:
SELECT employees.first_name, departments.name 
FROM employees 
CROSS JOIN departments;

It is important to note that when using joins, you should always include a condition in the ON clause to specify how the tables are related, otherwise you'll get cartesian product of the two tables.





SQL window functions, also known as analytic functions, allow you to perform calculations on sets of data within a query. Window functions operate on a set of rows called a "window" and return a single value for each row in the result set. Some common window functions include:

ROW_NUMBER(): assigns a unique number to each row within the result set, based on the order specified in the ORDER BY clause.

Example:
SELECT ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY salary DESC) AS rank, first_name, last_name, salary 
FROM employees;


RANK(): assigns a rank to each row within the result set, based on the order specified in the ORDER BY clause. Rows with the same value will receive the same rank.

Example:
SELECT RANK() OVER (ORDER BY salary DESC) AS rank, first_name, last_name, salary 
FROM employees;


DENSE_RANK(): assigns a rank to each row within the result set, based on the order specified in the ORDER BY clause. Rows with the same value will receive the same rank, and there will be no gaps in the ranking.

Example:
SELECT DENSE_RANK() OVER (ORDER BY salary DESC) AS rank, first_name, last_name, salary 
FROM employees;


NTILE(n): assigns a group number (from 1 to n) to each row within the result set, based on the order specified in the ORDER BY clause. It is used to divide the result set into n number of groups or "tiles".

Example:
SELECT NTILE(4) OVER (ORDER BY salary DESC) AS quartile, first_name, last_name, salary 
FROM employees;


SUM() or COUNT() or AVG(): allows you to perform calculations on a set of rows, using the OVER() clause to specify the window or range of rows to include in the calculation.

Example:
SELECT first_name, last_name, salary, SUM(salary) OVER (PARTITION BY department) AS department_total 
FROM employees;


It is important to note that window functions are applied after the WHERE and JOIN clauses, but before the GROUP BY and HAVING clauses. So the result set after window functions are applied will be used for these clauses.
